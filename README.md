# Data Visualization with D3.js

This talk will cover the basics of data visualization and how it relates
to web development. It will serve as an introduction to D3.js and SVG and
how these tools relate to create impressive visualizations from data.

## Prerequisites

-   HTML

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Explain what data visualization is and why it's an important
    part of web development.
-   Define SVG and use it to create basic shapes on a webpage.
-   Explain the advantages of SVG over bitmap images.
-   Install D3.js and its related modules to be used in a project.
-   Explain the basics of data binding.

## Preparation

1.  Just follow along!
